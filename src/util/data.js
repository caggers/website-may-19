        I am a maker at heart who is happiest covered head to toe in glitter, paint and LEDs.
        The most important thing for me is to work with smart and creative people who inspire me. 
        I genuinely enjoy peer programming and code reviews as part of a healthy and happy team.
        A day in my perfect role would have lots of opportunities for collaboration with two way learning and teaching.  `],

  text: [
    `I’ve had an unconventional journey; I have an undergraduate degree in Fine Art and Art History and an MSc. in Computer Science.`,
    `Until recently I was contracted as a Front End Developer with LexisNexis in Dublin. As the first UI Dev to be hired into a team working on a complete product overhaul I established the React-based architecture, testing protocol and styling framework in addition to implementing a state management solution using the new React Hooks api. I ran frequent feedback sessions and group merge requests to keep the rest of my team up to date on my progress despite their unfamiliarity with React.`,
    `From 2016 - 2018 I was working as a Software Engineer at Accenture’s new state of the art Research and Development centre in Grand Canal Dock. It's a role that required me to be highly collaborative and innovative. Although I technically lived in the Front End Guild, every day was different and I found myself working with everything from 3D printing to Voice UI to IOT to Wearables.`,
    `It was through Accenture that I started mentoring with Coder Dojo. I am incredibly proud of my work with the Dojo; two ninjas I mentored went on to win European Digital Girl of the year in 2017 and in May 2018 I spoke on a panel at Coolest Projects.`,
    `I’m passionate about technology and reaching out to the next generation of women in Tech. I’ve written some blogs about my experiences so far  which you can read below.`
